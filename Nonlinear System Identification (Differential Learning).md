There has been interest in applying neural networks to identification and control of nonlinear systems. Nonlinear system identification can be approached as the approximation of the system behavior by [[Dynamic Neural Network]]s. Some results are classified in two groups:

1) the first one, as a natural extension, is based on the function approximation properties of static neural networks. Is limited for time belonging to a closed set.
2) Uses the operator representation of the system to derive conditions for the validity of its approximation by a dynamic neural network.
